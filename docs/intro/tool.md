`HopMyTrack` is an advanced **OSINT** (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to help users uncover a wide range of publicly available information about individuals.

It uses a variety of techniques to gather data from various sources, including social media platforms, public records, and other online resources.

```bash
$ hmt "username:john_doe;first_name:John;last_name:Doe" # Search for information about John Doe
```

The hmt command-line tool is the primary way to interact with `HopMyTrack`. It allows you to search for information about individuals using a variety of search parameters.

```bash
$ hmt --help        # Display the help message
$ hmt --version     # Check the version of HopMyTrack
$ hmt --update      # Update HopMyTrack to the latest version
```

`HopMyTrack` also includes an interactive mode that provides a more user-friendly experience. Simply run the `hmt` command without any arguments to enter interactive mode.

```bash
$ hmt               # Enter interactive mode
```
